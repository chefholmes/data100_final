    <h1>2018-2019 Season</h1>
    <main>
    <p>The 2018-2019 is the last season before the movement of the three point line and the first year we looked at. This year there is not a significant difference between any one team and proved to be a good baseline year. </p>

            There was not a single team that shot over 1,000 three-pointers, and Duke had the most three-pointers
             attempted yet obtained the lowest three-point percentage. Duke and Eastern Kentucky shot more three-pointers than 
             Florida A&M because Duke has the Power 5 trend, allowing better shooters, and Eastern Kentucky shot more due to their 
             style of play. Furthermore, teams like Duke can change their playing style every year because they are constantly acquiring
              the best players in the country, so the adjustment for these players isn't a challenge due to their high skill level. Duke showed 
              the Power 5 trend again in two-point field goals as they shot 58%, nearly 10% better than the two 
              mid-major schools, at a very high volume. This percentage is outstanding and important to note going forward. We see 
              Florida A&M shoot a higher percentage from three, 4% higher, than Eastern Kentucky, which is a trend that is not repeated in the other two years we researched. Lastly, this was the only year Duke attempted the most amount of three-pointers between the three schools.
