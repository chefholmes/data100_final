    <h1>2019-2020 Season</h1>
    <main>
    <p>This season was the first season after the movement of the three point line backwards to 22 feet 1 and 3/4th inches and 
        the results showed an obvious change in the landscape of college basketball. </p>

        <p>
          This season is arguably the most important season from a data perspective because it is the first year with a further three point line,
        meaning teams have not yet adjusted to the change, which resulted in unique results. Florida A&M shot only 377 three pointers
    yet managed to shoot only 28%, an extremely bad percentage. This is difficult because shooting such a little amount would expect a higher percentage.
     Eastern Kentucky, the team we picked because of their high volume and ability to make three pointers shoot just over 800 at 32%, 6% below the expectec percentage from three. 
    The percentages for both these teams are exemplified how the movement of the line immediately changed style of play, especially for mid-major basketball.
In doing so it showed that these teams will have to adjust and learn how to make the necessary changes going forward, which we see in the 2021-2022 season statistics. 
The Power 5 trend continued to hold still as Duke did not have as much as a significant change as the other two schools in adjusting to the new line.       </p>
