    <h1>Our Vision</h1>
    <main>
    <p>
        We wanted to see how the movement of the three point line in college basketball after the 2018-2019 season affected the playstyle of college basketball.
        We hoped and were able to identify the difference in shots attempted with a focus on three pointers attempted while also seeing the change in the pace of play and other trends that could occur.

        <p>
          We selected the two mid-major schools because we wanted a team that shot three pointers at a very high volume, Eastern Kentucky, 
          and on the opposite spectrum a team that shot a very low amount of three pointers, Florida A&M, over the three years we collected data from. 
        We also wanted to pick a historically strong Power 5, a team from one of the top 5 conferences in college basketball, team as a baseline and to show possible differences bewteen mid-major playstyle and Power 5 playstyle.
        Lastly, we wanted to show each college's colors somehow, as college basketball is driven by their great fans so we interpreted the team colors in the navigation bar and the color a link changes to once being visited.
      </p>
        <h3>Our Findings</h3>
        <p>
            Our biggest discovery was the obvious difference between mid-major teams and Power 5 teams, which we will refer to as the 
            "Power 5 trend" throughout our website. This trend shows how Power 5 teams do not rely on a specific playstyle due to their 
            players being the top players in the country. This allows teams like Duke to easily adjust to the changes in college basketball 
            year by year without having to worry about the best way for them to consistently score. We also found that the movement of the
             three-point line sped up the pace of play within college basketball. Teams began playing at a much quicker pace, which resulted
              in a significant increase in shots taken by each team. These two findings proved to us our theory that the newer generation of 
              college basketball is quicker and stronger, which, combined with the movement of the three-point line, has resulted in faster,
               more offensively heavy games. These findings showed us and helped us understand the effect of the movement of the line and 
               allowed us to understand college basketball in more depth, which we hope to show in our descriptions of our data.

            Important to note: We exempted the 2020-2021 season as it was the Covid season and statistics were outliers as teams played less
            games than usual, which would have made for unaccurate data.
