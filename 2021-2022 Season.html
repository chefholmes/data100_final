    <p>The 2021-2022 season higlighted the differences of skillsets between mid-major basketball and high-major basketball, highlighting how mid-major teams have to be more strategic with their playstyle.   </p>

          The first thing to note is the volume at which Eastern Kentucky shot three-pointers, over 1,000 times, and how efficient they were at doing so. 
          Shooting nearly 50% from three is extremely impressive, especially on that many shot attempts. On the flip side, 
          Florida A&M had the opposite playstyle, rarely attempting three-pointers and focusing on two-pointers, as reflected 
          in their 47.4% two-point attempt rate. The biggest takeaway is how dominant Duke is across the board and how this reflects 
          the Power 5 trend. Duke shot just under 1,000 threes at a 36% rate, which is around the average for teams, while also shooting 56% 
          from the field in general, an extremely impressive feat. The next closest percentage is Florida A&M, 14% less than Duke, 
          which is still a respectable field goal percentage.
